      <p>Welcom to my page, my name is Khalil and this is my story with coding. During my undergraduate course(civil engineering), I had my first coding subject and it was about visual basic. Even it was just a simple and old programming language, I was very delight to type my first piece of code.
        During my MSc in transport engineering and planning course, I learned how to plan and work on high strategic softwares like cube and VISSIM. Therefore, I decided to learn more about programming language like, Java, Paython, HTML and CSS, to improve my coding skills and combine my engineering knowldege with programming skills.

      </P>
